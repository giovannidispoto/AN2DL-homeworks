### Image classification

Competition available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/artificial-neural-networks-and-deep-learning-2020/overview).
We have created a CNN that discriminate between images depending on the following cases:
1) All the people in the image are wearing a mask
2) No person in the image is wearing a mask
3) Someone in the image is not wearing a mask. In the following 3 examples of image from the training belonging to the three cases (Up-Left (1), Up-Right (3), Bottom (2)).

There are 2 models: One based on Trasfer Learning on VGG19 model trained on ImageNet Dataset and a model trained from scratch.
